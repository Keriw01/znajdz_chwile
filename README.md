The main functionality of "Znajdź Chwilę" is displaying a list of events based on a selected date or a range of days from the calendar. You can freely navigate through the calendar and select a specific day or range of days, then the app will display a list of events related to that date. In addition, you can change the calendar display mode for a week, fortnight or a whole month to suit your preferences.

Adding events is simple and intuitive. You can enter an event title, optional description, start and end date, tags, and set a notification if necessary. So you can focus on your important dates and make sure you don't miss any event.

"Znajdź Chwilę" also provides useful statistics for the current user. You can track your daily progress, monthly progress and overall progress. In addition, the application allows you to categorize events using three different types of tags, which allows you to analyze statistics based on these categories.
